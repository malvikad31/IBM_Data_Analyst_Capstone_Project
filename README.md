# IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project
Includes all the projects completed for the final IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project.

## Description
The purpose of this capstone project was to contextualize and analyze the technology-related trends and preferences of surveyed developers from across the world. The dataset used was the [2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-2019). Each project (or file) in the overall Capstone Project repository involves a step of the data analysis process:

- [Web Scraping](https://github.com/malvikad31/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/Web-Scraping-Lab%20(1).ipynb)
- [Data Exploration](https://github.com/malvikad31/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/ExploreDataSet-lab.ipynb) (i.e. observation of the dataset)
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/malvikad31/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/ExploratoryDataAnalysis-lab.ipynb) (i.e. identifying and removing outliers, identifying the distribution of the data and any correlations)
- [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/malvikad31/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/DataWrangling-lab.ipynb) (i.e. identifying and removing duplicate/missing values, normalizing the data)
- [Data Visualization](https://github.com/malvikad31/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/DataVisualization-lab.ipynb) (i.e. visualizing the distribution, relationships, and comparisons)
Note: Data exploration and wrangling were conducted using Python on JupyterNotebook. Visualization was conducted using a combination of Python and SQL on JuptyerNotebook as well as through [dashboards created on IBM Cognos Analytics](https://github.com/malvikad31/IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project/blob/main/Survey%20Dashboard%20-%20IBM%20Cognos.pdf).
